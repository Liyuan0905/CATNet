# Consistency-Guided Adaptive Alternating Training for Semi-Supervised Salient Object Detection (TCSVT 2025)

[Paper link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10876394)


This is the PyTorch implementation for CATNet. We build it based on TEP (https://github.com/JingZhang617/EBMGSOD).


## Saliency Maps
Results of our model on benchmark datasets(DUTS, DUT-OMRON, ECSSD, PASCAL-S, HKU-IS, SOD, MSRA-B, MSRA-10K, THUR15K) can be found:
